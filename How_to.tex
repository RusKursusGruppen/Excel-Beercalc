\section*{Before you start using the oelregnskab.ods}

\begin{itemize}

\item Go to \emph{onsdag}: Input the names of all the \emph{russer} and the \emph{vejledere}

\item Go to \emph{gratis}: Put in the amount agreed to about how much profit should be made to RKG.

\item Go to \emph{beholdning}: Write the prices and amounts of the different beverages bought. Remember to verify the numbers by counting, rather than relying on the what was ordered. Suppliers can, and are known to, be wrong.

\end{itemize}

\section*{While using the oelregnskab.ods}

\begin{itemize}

\item Transfer \emph{streger}: Transfer the \emph{streger} from the \emph{stregliste} to the corresponding days ark. i.e. \emph{onsdag} for the \emph{streger} sat on Wednesday.

\item Count the stock: Count how much of each item is actually leftover and input the numbers in the \emph{opt√¶lling} sheet. This is done to see how many \emph{streger} the \emph{russer} are putting and to calculate the suggested prices (see below).

\item Set prices: Look at the suggested prices in the bottom of the days ark. Use those prices to decide on the specific prices for the \emph{russer} and \emph{rusvejldere}. Note that it is often desirable to put the prices a little higher the first couple of days to ensure that the desired profit is accumulated. One can then make the beers on the later days a bit cheaper.

\item In the end: At the end of the \emph{rustur}, input how much is returned and how much is brought back to DIKU in the \emph{Beholdning} sheet.

\item Collect money: Round up the \emph{russer} one by one and make them pay the amount they owe. Put in the amount they pay in column M of the day they are paying for. Note that the system is fine with them paying in advance, i.e. putting down more money than they owe on a specific day.

\end{itemize}
